# uv2xyz

## Description
#### 
This repo contains calculations of a 3D (xyz) point in real world coordinates system, given the corresponding 2D point (u,v). 
In AVFormula context: given a couple of input image (stereo RGB images or 1 RGB + 1 radial depth) - provide the real-world 3D coordiante of the detected objects (cones) of the image . 
In other words, this repo aimds to provide several solution to the problem : 
Detected Cone in an image (u,v) -> THIS REPO -> The detected cone (x,y,z) relative to a known point on the car.
